### Week 1: Physics Playground
- Description: Introduction to Unity physics components and environment setup.
  
### Week 2: 2D Player Controller
- Description: Implementation of basic player movement and input controls in a 2D environment.

### Week 3: Tilemap Level & Player Animation
- Description: Creation of a tilemap level, addition of player movement animation, and integration of platform effector 2D.

### Week 4: GameManager & Checkpoint System
- Description: Development of a GameManager, implementation of a checkpoint and respawn system, inclusion of traps, and basic UI setup. Updated player animations for jumping and falling.

### Week 5: Simple Enemy AI
- Description: Introduction of a simple enemy with basic AI and state management. Implementation of enemy movement towards the player's direction.

### Week 6: 3D Level & Navmesh Setup
- Description: Creation of a 3D level using Probuilder and setting up Navmesh for enemy chasing. Implementation of mouse-click movement for the player.

### Week 7: 3D Animations & Enemy Patrol
- Description: Setup of animations for the 3D player and enemy characters. Introduction of enemy patrol behavior when not in pursuit of the player.

### Week 8: Shader Creation & Bonus Content
- Description: Creation of a simple shader using Shader Graph. Bonus points awarded for creating a simple sequence/cutscene using Timeline, along with post-processing effects in the scene.

### Final Project
- Description: Development of a 2D game where the player, a farmer, navigates through a maze to find their cow. The player can utilize bombs to defeat enemies and clear obstacles, while also collecting money for medication expenses.
